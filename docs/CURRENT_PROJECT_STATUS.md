# Current Project Status

This is the current truth of the repository after the external-safe axis repair
milestone.

## Latest Safety Baseline

```text
latest recorded safety commit = a2cbc19 Add external-safe axis conflict quarantine
current cleanup target = Prune legacy benchmark surface and publish canonical folding stack
```

The cleanup target does not add biology logic. It republishes the current
canonical surface and archives legacy benchmark artifacts.

## Internal 50-Row Status

The internal 50-row benchmark is closed as a development safety benchmark:

```text
axis_profile_coverage = 0.86
axis_profile_same_axis_conflict_count = 0
forced_same_axis_conflict_count = 0
high_confidence_wrong_count_after_axis_scoring = 0
global_fold_class_claim_allowed = false
folding_problem_solved = false
claim_allowed = false
```

This does not mean folding is solved. It means the old internal same-axis
safety failures are closed.

## External 100-Row Status

The external holdout before repair exposed unsafe generalization:

```text
axis_profile_coverage = 0.78
axis_profile_same_axis_conflict_count = 22
architecture_axis_same_axis_conflict_count = 14
unsafe_axis_claim_count = 36
high_confidence_wrong_count_after_axis_scoring = 17
```

The external-safe repair closes those unsafe claims by abstention:

```text
post_repair_axis_profile_coverage = 0.55
post_repair_axis_profile_same_axis_conflict_count = 0
post_repair_architecture_axis_same_axis_conflict_count = 0
post_repair_unsafe_axis_claim_count = 0
post_repair_high_confidence_wrong_count_after_axis_scoring = 0
order_axis_folded_mimic_quarantined_count = 22
repeat_compact_ambiguity_quarantined_count = 14
coverage_loss_from_external_safety = 0.23
external_safety_repair_successful = true
```

Coverage loss is the intended cost of the repair.

Archived legacy artifacts:

```text

```

## Known Limits

```text
protein folding is not solved
global fold-class coverage is still locked
axis profile coverage is partial
secondary-structure evidence is still thin on the external holdout
architecture evidence is conservative after repair
legacy feature modules still contain useful low-level primitives
```

The current state is useful as a safe falsification and abstention stack, not
as a predictive folding system.

## Next Allowed Research Target

Do not add more broad biology claims before the canonical surface stays clean.

The next research target can be:

```text
external secondary-structure evidence calibration
```

Allowed shape:

```text
improve evidence packets
preserve truth-after-prediction scoring
keep global fold-class claims locked
track coverage cost
record uncertainty and abstention reasons
```

Forbidden shape:

```text
force beta/mixed/ordered labels to improve coverage
use holdout truth during prediction
recover collapsed-class coverage
claim folding solved
generate proteins, molecules, binders, therapies, or dosing logic
```

## Clean Zip

For sharing, export from tracked files only:

```bash
git archive --format=zip --output pharmacotopology-clean.zip HEAD
```

This avoids local caches and runtime directories.
